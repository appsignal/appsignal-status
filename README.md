AppSignal solves all your Ruby monitoring needs in a single tool. You and your
team can focus on writing code and we'll provide the alerts if your app has any
issues.

This is the public status page repository, used to render the public status pages for customers.
It consists of a Next.js app that fetches data from our API and renders a status page.

This code is open-source, but this does not mean we're obligated to support running this code on your own system.

  npm install
```

# Run the project

# Testing

Every component should be covered by (Jest) tests, run the tests with:
